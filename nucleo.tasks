Things to Work On:
    ☐ Add col-sm-6 to Nova upgrade rows
    ☐ Show price for next generator and gray out when set to buy max and can't afford any
    ☐ Number H required for next xH on prestige screen
    ☐ Upgrade price too close on smaller screens
    ☐ Global upgrade width uneven
    ☐ Mark upgraded generators? Condense upgrades to one line, disable unpurchased upgrades..
    ☐ Show % of total production?
    ☐ Make sidebar collapsible?
    ☐ Use a card-type display for each element and include the generators on it? Condense periodic table display down for purchasing and seeing discoveries and summary.. maybe consider some kind of isotope display.
    ☐ Something like this?
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_nuclides
    ☐ Change 'element' link so that the entire item is clickable, not just the name.
